# 3 Tech Facts

## 1. The Origin of "Spam" in Email
Ever wondered why unsolicited emails are called "spam"? The term was inspired by a Monty Python sketch where a group of Vikings in a café repeatedly sing "Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam" over the top of other dialogue. Just as the Vikings’ chorus was hard to ignore, so too are those pesky unwanted emails!

## 2. The First Computer Bug Was a Real Bug
The term "computer bug" is now a staple in tech jargon, but did you know it originated from an actual insect? In 1947, Grace Hopper, a pioneer of computer science, found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped the moth into the logbook with the note: "First actual case of bug being found." Thus, the term "debugging" was born. :)

## 3. The First 1GB Hard Drive Was Huge
In 1980, IBM released the first 1GB hard drive. It was the size of a refrigerator, weighed over 500 pounds, and cost $40,000. Today, you can get a 1TB hard drive that fits in your pocket for a fraction of the cost.
